# COMP6324

For this project, we were asked to build a solution for "Making bank branches enjoyable".We came up with the idea of proximity beacons which detect the customers phone whne the customer walks in the bank branch. The beacons are placed at the entrance doors. When the customer walks in the branch they are assigned with a ticket number and later a customer representative calls in the customer via their dashboard using "Next Customer option". Once the custoemr is served, that ticket entry is bumped form the dashboard using the "delete" button. The customers can provide feedback at the end of the service. This saves the time of customers and helps the bank to keep a track of how many customers visits their branch and what areas needs to be improved using the feedback.

I designed a Dashboard which shows all the activity of how many customers are in queue, what service do they need. We used machine learning to forecast how many customers are expected on a particular day and at some particular time which are shows using line charts, pie charts and other graphs.
